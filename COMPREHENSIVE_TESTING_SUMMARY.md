python3 run_comprehensive_testing.py single
```

### Step 2: Execute Full Improvement Process
```bash
# Run iterative improvement (recommended 5 iterations)
python3 run_comprehensive_testing.py full 5
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
The system will:
1. **Run comprehensive tests** across all scenarios
2. **Analyze results** to identify improvement opportunities
3. **Apply fixes** to agent logic, prompts, and routing
4. **Track progress** toward 95% accuracy target
5. **Generate reports** with detailed metrics and suggestions

### Step 4: Iterate Until Target Achieved
- Continue running improvement cycles
- Focus on specific failure patterns
- Enhance agent prompts and decision logic
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
