**Target: 95% Accuracy**

## Core Issues Identified

1. **Missing OpenAI API Configuration**: Tests failing due to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'invoke'`
2. **Tool Integration Problems**: Missing tool references in agents
3. **Agent Routing Failures**: Router defaulting to sales instead of proper routing
4. **Analytics Key Errors**: Error tracking system failing
5. **API Endpoint Issues**: Missing endpoints and 404 errors
